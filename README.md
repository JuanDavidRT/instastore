## Improvements and trade offs
1. What would you improve from your code? why?
R:
Security and maybe there is a cleaner way to implement the GoogleMaps Api
2. Which trade offs would you make to accomplish this on time? What'd you do next time to deliver more and sacrifice less?
R:
I sacrified the backend connection i just made a draft of it.
3. Do you think your service is secure? why?
R:
Is not the safest service in the world but having only the index and the logo for the user is good.
4. What would you do to measure the behaviour of your product on a production environment?
R:
I will measure the times users click on try again and the time they spent after the nearest place is shown.
